# Openverse Catalog

This repository contains the methods used to identify over 1.4 billion Creative
Commons licensed works. The challenge is that these works are dispersed
throughout the web and identifying them requires a combination of techniques.

Two approaches are currently in use:

1. Web crawl data
2. Application Programming Interfaces (API Data)

## Web Crawl Data

The Common Crawl Foundation provides an open repository of petabyte-scale web
crawl data. A new dataset is published at the end of each month comprising over
200 TiB of uncompressed data.

The data is available in three file formats:

- WARC (Web ARChive): the entire raw data, including HTTP response metadata,
  WARC metadata, etc.
- WET: extracted plaintext from each webpage.
- WAT: extracted html metadata, e.g. HTTP headers and hyperlinks, etc.

For more information about these formats, please see the
[Common Crawl documentation][ccrawl_doc].

Openverse Catalog uses AWS Data Pipeline service to automatically create an Amazon EMR
cluster of 100 c4.8xlarge instances that will parse the WAT archives to identify
all domains that link to creativecommons.org. Due to the volume of data, Apache
Spark is used to streamline the processing. The output of this methodology is a
series of parquet files that contain:

- the domains and its respective content path and query string (i.e. the exact
  webpage that links to creativecommons.org)
- the CC referenced hyperlink (which may indicate a license),
- HTML meta data in JSON format which indicates the number of images on each
  webpage and other domains that they reference,
- the location of the webpage in the WARC file so that the page contents can be
  found.

The steps above are performed in [`ExtractCCLinks.py`][ex_cc_links].

## API Data

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is used to manage the workflow for
various API ETL jobs which pull and process data from a number of open APIs on
the internet.

### API Workflows

Our API-based workflows run at different schedules: some daily, others monthly. Please consider which to use whenever a new DAG is written, and add your new script to one of these schedules.

#### Daily

Workflows that have a `schedule_string='@daily'` parameter are run daily. The DAG
workflows run `provider_api_scripts` to load and extract media data from the APIs. The following provider scripts are run daily:

- [Flickr](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/flickr.py)
- [Met Museum](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/metropolitan_museum_of_art.py)
- [PhyloPic](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/phylopic.py)
- [Wikimedia Commons](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/wikimedia_commons.py)

#### Monthly

Some API ingestion workflows are scheduled to run on the 15th day of each
month at 16:00 UTC. These workflows are reserved for long-running jobs or
APIs that do not have date filtering capabilities, so the data is reprocessed
monthly to keep the catalog updated. The following provider scripts are run monthly:

- [Brooklyn Museum](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/brooklyn_museum.py)
- [Cleveland Museum of Art](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/cleveland_museum_of_art.py)
- [Common Crawl Syncer](openverse_catalog/dags/commoncrawl_scripts/commoncrawl_s3_syncer/SyncImageProviders.py)
- [NYPL](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/nypl.py)
- [RawPixel](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/raw_pixel.py)
- [StockSnap](openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts/stocksnap.py)

### TSV to Postgres Loader

The Airflow DAG defined in [`loader_workflow.py`][db_loader] runs every minute,
and loads the oldest file which has not been modified in the last 15 minutes
into the upstream database. It includes some data preprocessing steps.

[db_loader]: openverse_catalog/dags/loader_workflow.py

See each provider API script's notes in their respective [handbook][ov-handbook] entry.

## Development setup for Airflow and API puller scripts

There are a number of scripts in the directory
[`openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts`][api_scripts] eventually
loaded into a database to be indexed for searching in the Openverse API. These run in a
different environment than the PySpark portion of the project, and so have their
own dependency requirements.

[api_scripts]: openverse_catalog/dags/provider_api_scripts

### Development setup

You'll need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine, with
versions new enough to use version `3` of Docker Compose `.yml` files.

You will also need the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) command runner installed.

To set up the local python environment along with the pre-commit hook, run:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
just install
```

To set up environment variables run:

```shell
just dotenv
```

If needed, fill in API keys or other secrets and variables in `.env`. This is
not needed if you only want to run the tests. There is a
[`docker-compose.yml`][dockercompose] provided in the
[`openverse_catalog`][cc_airflow] directory, so from that directory, run

```shell
just up
```

This results, among other things, in the following running containers:

- `openverse_catalog_webserver_1`
- `openverse_catalog_postgres_1`
- `openverse_catalog_s3_1`

and some networking setup so that they can communicate. Note:

- `openverse_catalog_webserver_1` is running the Apache Airflow daemon, and also
  has a few development tools (e.g., `pytest`) installed.
- `openverse_catalog_postgres_1` is running PostgreSQL, and is setup with some
  databases and tables to emulate the production environment. It also provides a
  database for Airflow to store its running state.
- The directory containing the DAG files, as well as dependencies will be
  mounted to the `usr/local/airflow/dags` directory in the container
  `openverse_catalog_webserver_1`.

At this stage, you can run the tests via:

```shell
just test
```

Edits to the source files or tests can be made on your local machine, then tests
can be run in the container via the above command to see the effects.

If you'd like, it's possible to login to the webserver container via:

```shell
just shell
```

If you just need to run an airflow command, you can use the `airflow` recipe. Arguments passed to airflow must be quoted:

```shell
just airflow "config list"
```

To follow the logs of the running container:

```shell
just logs
```

To see the Airflow web UI, point your browser to `localhost:9090`. The default user name and password for the airflow UI are both `airflow`.

If you'd like to bring down the containers, run

```shell
just down
```

To reset the test DB (wiping out all databases, schemata, and tables), run

```shell
just down -v
```

`docker volume prune` can also be useful if you've already stopped the running containers, but be warned that it will remove all volumes associated with stopped containers, not just openverse-catalog ones.

To fully recreate everything from the ground up, you can use:

```shell
just recreate
```
