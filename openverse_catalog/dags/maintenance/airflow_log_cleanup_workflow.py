"""
A maintenance workflow that you can deploy into Airflow to periodically clean
out the task logs to avoid those getting too big. By default, this will also
clean child process logs from the 'scheduler' directory.

Can remove all log files by setting "maxLogAgeInDays" to -1.
If you want to test the DAG in the Airflow Web UI, you can also set
enableDelete to `false`, and then you will see a list of log folders
that can be deleted, but will not actually delete them.

This should all go on one line:
```
airflow dags trigger --conf
'{"maxLogAgeInDays":-1, "enableDelete": "false"}' airflow_log_cleanup
```
`--conf` options:
- maxLogAgeInDays:<INT> - Optional
- enableDelete:<BOOLEAN> - Optional
