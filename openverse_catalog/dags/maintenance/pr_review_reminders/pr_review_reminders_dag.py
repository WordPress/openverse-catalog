# PR Review Reminders

Iterates through open PRs in our repositories and pings assigned reviewers
who have not yet approved the PR or explicitly requested changes.

This DAG runs daily and pings on the following schedule based on priority label:

| priority | days |
| --- | --- |
| critical | 1 day |
| high | >2 days |
| medium | >4 days |
| low | >7 days |

The DAG does not ping on Saturday and Sunday and accounts for weekend days
when determining how much time has passed since the review.

Unfortunately the DAG does not know when someone is on vacation. It is up to the
author of the PR to re-assign review if one of the randomly selected reviewers
is unavailable for the time period during which the PR should be reviewed.
