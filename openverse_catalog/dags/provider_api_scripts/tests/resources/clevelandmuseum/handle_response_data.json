He was befriended by poet Max Buchon, who would later write the first article on Courbet, claiming that he was the artist for the people. In 1837, hoping that Gustave would become a lawyer, his father sent him to the Coll\u00e8ge Royal in Besan\u00e7on. Despite his father's ambitions, Courbet began to study art at the academy there with Charles-Antoine Flageoulot (1774-1840), a former student of David (q.v.). By 1839 Courbet had moved to Paris to pursue a career in art. He refrained from entering the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, studying instead briefly with Charles de Steuben (1788-1856) and preferring to learn how to paint by copying the works of the Old Masters in the museums. Courbet also wanted to work after life models and enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. He began to submit paintings to the Salon, the majority of which were rejected. In 1846-47 Courbet traveled to the Netherlands where he studied the works of Rembrandt and Hals. The following year ten of his paintings were shown at the Salon, and together with his friends Baudelaire, Champfleury, and Buchon he became labeled a \"realist.\" Courbet's paintings shown at the 1851 Salon-Stonebreakers (1849, formerly Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, destroyed during World War II), Peasants of Flagey (1850-55, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Besan\u00e7on), and The Burial at Ornans (1849-50, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)-elicited criticism. Because Courbet represented the peasants as he saw them, without ennobling or idealizing them, his works met with disapproval. Moreover, these representations of peasants appeared at a time when the upper classes felt threatened by social unrest and by the instability of the republic. In 1855 Courbet financed an independent Pavillon du R\u00e9alisme near the Universal Exposition, where he showed his Painter's Studio (1854-55, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). He began to travel extensively, including visits to Gent, Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Cologne, Mainz, and Strasbourg. He returned to Germany in 1858, and while in Frankfurt, he began to paint the stag hunts he witnessed. The following year he visited the Normandy coast, painting seascapes, some of which became almost abstractions. Courbet turned to still lifes in 1862-63 when visiting the Saintonge area, yet he still continued to create landscapes and portraits. By 1870 he was offered the Legion of Honor but refused it because of his opposition to the imperial government. During the Paris Commune from March to May 1871, Courbet became an active member of the government. As chairman of the Commission for the Protection of the Artistic Monuments of Paris, he suggested the Vend\u00f4me Column be dismantled because it was an imperial symbol. The Commune decided instead to topple the column. When the Commune was defeated, Courbet was held responsible for this act of vandalism and was jailed for six months. In 1873 the government decided to rebuild the column at Courbet's expense. Unable to pay and fearful of being arrested, Courbet moved to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1819", "death_year": "1877"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 112.4 x 93 x 12.1 cm (44 1/4 x 36 5/8 x 4 3/4 in.); Unframed: 81 x 61.2 cm (31 7/8 x 24 1/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.124, "width": 0.93, "depth": 0.121}, "unframed": {"height": 0.81, "width": 0.612}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Leonard C.

But he had already shown an interest in art and had also registered to copy at the Louvre. In 1855 he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and became a student of Louis Lamothe (1822-1869), a former pupil of Ingres (q.v.). One year later Degas made the traditional journey to Italy, remaining there for three years. He visited family members in Naples and Florence and attended life classes at the Villa Medici in Rome. A visit to Normandy in 1861 may have introduced him to the racetrack. In Paris he continued to study at the Louvre, where he met Manet (q.v.) in 1862. Apart from his continuous interest in portraiture and history painting, Degas began to pay attention to subjects of modern life. Between 1865 and 1870, he exhibited at the Salon. At the time of the Franco-Prussian War, he enlisted in the artillery, but because of his poor eyesight he served (with Manet) in the infantry. After the war he traveled first to London and, in 1872-73, visited his uncle and brothers who had a cotton business in New Orleans. Degas participated in the first impressionist exhibition of 1874. He continued to exhibit with these artists until 1886 but never completely considered himself a member of the group, preferring to call himself a realist or naturalist. While many of the impressionists painted en plein air, Degas worked with models in his studio and, later in his career, from his imagination. In addition to painting, he experimented often with monotypes, engraving, pastels, sculpture, and photography. He traveled extensively-London, Naples, Spain, Morocco, and Switzerland-but continued to draw his subject matter from modern-day Paris. Other recurring themes would be the female nude and the ballet dancer. After the impressionist exhibition of 1886, Degas no longer participated in group shows. Instead he sold his works to private dealers such as Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. In the 1890s he began his own art collection, which, besides many works on paper, included paintings by such artists as Ingres, C\u00e9zanne (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), and van Gogh (q.v.). His own art at the time became characterized by broader strokes of paint, charcoal, and pastel and the use of more vibrant colors, partly because of problems with his vision. His failing eyesight and poor health caused him to abandon his pursuit of art during the last years of his life.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1834", "death_year": "1917"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 103 x 233.5 x 7 cm (40 9/16 x 91 15/16 x 2 3/4 in.); Unframed: 70 x 200.5 cm (27 9/16 x 78 15/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.03, "width": 2.335, "depth": 0.07}, "unframed": {"height": 0.7, "width": 2.005}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of the Hanna Fund", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Signed in lower right: Degas\r\n", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "Exhibition of the Month: Art is Long", "description": "<i>Exhibition of the Month: Art is Long</i>.

In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-R\u00e9my, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Proven\u00e7al works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1853", "death_year": "1890"}], "culture": ["Netherlands, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 104.5 x 124.5 x 7.6 cm (41 1/8 x 49 x 3 in.); Unframed: 73.4 x 91.8 cm (28 7/8 x 36 1/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.045, "width": 1.245, "depth": 0.076}, "unframed": {"height": 0.734, "width": 0.918}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of the Hanna Fund", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "Work by Vincent Van Gogh", "description": "<i>Work by Vincent Van Gogh</i>.

In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-R\u00e9my, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Proven\u00e7al works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1853", "death_year": "1890"}], "culture": ["Netherlands, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 72.5 x 73.5 x 8.5 cm (28 9/16 x 28 15/16 x 3 3/8 in.); Unframed: 50.2 x 50.5 cm (19 3/4 x 19 7/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.725, "width": 0.735, "depth": 0.085}, "unframed": {"height": 0.502, "width": 0.505}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to F\u00e9camp, then \u00c9tretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouill\u00e8re on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the H\u00f4tel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to V\u00e9theuil with the Hosched\u00e9s, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hosched\u00e9 spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie.

Intense light---reflected from the snow-covered landscape---floods the room, obliterating details along the walls and floor. The off-center window frame and the blurriness achieved through sketchy brushstrokes suggest the scanning movement of the artist's eye as he viewed this scene. Contrasted with cold blues and silver whites, Camille's red cape draws the viewer's attention through the glass and into a swift exchange of glances, registering a brief moment in time.

C\u00e9zanne enrolled at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin in 1857, entering the studio of Joseph Gibert (1806-1884). Two years later, complying with his father's wishes, he began studying law at the Universit\u00e9 d'Aix while still at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin. In 1861 C\u00e9zanne finally left law school and followed Zola to Paris where he met Pissarro (q.v.) at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. Probably after his failure to enter the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, he returned to Aix and began working at his father's bank. In 1862, however, C\u00e9zanne returned to Paris, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse and copied the works of the Old Masters in the Louvre. The works he produced during this period reflect the influence of Spanish painters such as Ribera (1591-1562) and Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664), and other predecessors such as Delacroix (q.v.). His submissions to the Salons of 1865 through 1870 (and even through 1881) did not receive the jury's approval; the reinstatement of the Salon des Refus\u00e9s was repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded. C\u00e9zanne traveled often between Aix and Paris until 1870. To escape the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he stayed in the south in L'Estaque, along with his mistress, Hortense Fiquet, whom he had met in 1869. C\u00e9zanne moved back north to Pontoise with Hortense and his son, Paul, in 1872 and worked with Pissarro and met Dr. Paul Gachet. The following year he moved again to nearby Auvers-sur-Oise with his family, continuing his work with Pissarro. In 1874 and 1877 C\u00e9zanne participated in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, but the severe criticism of his works led him to abstain from using this venue again. In 1878 his father learned of the existence of Hortense and Paul, who at that point were living in Marseille, and threatened to discontinue his allowance. While in the Midi, C\u00e9zanne often worked with Monticelli (q.v.). His art increasingly matured, and he began concentrating on the order and internal structure within his compositions, limiting his palette. During these years he also met Gauguin (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.), and always trav-eled, chiefly between Aix and L'Estaque. In 1886 C\u00e9zanne married Hortense, his father died, and the inheritance provided him with the financial means to live without constraints. He bought a house in Marlotte near Fontainebleau in 1892. In 1895 he had his first solo show at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard, who two years later bought all the artist's works from his studio near Corbeil. The dealer Paul Durand-Ruel became another important client. C\u00e9zanne participated in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1899, 1901, and 1902 and exhibited at La Libre Esth\u00e9tique in Brussels in 1901 and 1904, the Secession in Vienna in 1903, and the Salon d'Automne in 1904-6. He continued to study the underlying structure of nature, at times approaching abstraction by denying traditional perspective and using multiple viewpoints. He also began leaving portions of the canvas bare, giving some works an unfinished appearance. C\u00e9zanne's work had a tremendous influence on the artists of his time as well as those of subsequent generations, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of modern art.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1839", "death_year": "1906"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 95.5 x 113 x 7 cm (37 5/8 x 44 1/2 x 2 3/4 in.); Unframed: 65.6 x 81.5 cm (25 13/16 x 32 1/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.955, "width": 1.13, "depth": 0.07}, "unframed": {"height": 0.656, "width": 0.815}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "The James W.

C\u00e9zanne enrolled at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin in 1857, entering the studio of Joseph Gibert (1806-1884). Two years later, complying with his father's wishes, he began studying law at the Universit\u00e9 d'Aix while still at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin. In 1861 C\u00e9zanne finally left law school and followed Zola to Paris where he met Pissarro (q.v.) at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. Probably after his failure to enter the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, he returned to Aix and began working at his father's bank. In 1862, however, C\u00e9zanne returned to Paris, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse and copied the works of the Old Masters in the Louvre. The works he produced during this period reflect the influence of Spanish painters such as Ribera (1591-1562) and Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664), and other predecessors such as Delacroix (q.v.). His submissions to the Salons of 1865 through 1870 (and even through 1881) did not receive the jury's approval; the reinstatement of the Salon des Refus\u00e9s was repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded. C\u00e9zanne traveled often between Aix and Paris until 1870. To escape the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he stayed in the south in L'Estaque, along with his mistress, Hortense Fiquet, whom he had met in 1869. C\u00e9zanne moved back north to Pontoise with Hortense and his son, Paul, in 1872 and worked with Pissarro and met Dr. Paul Gachet. The following year he moved again to nearby Auvers-sur-Oise with his family, continuing his work with Pissarro. In 1874 and 1877 C\u00e9zanne participated in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, but the severe criticism of his works led him to abstain from using this venue again. In 1878 his father learned of the existence of Hortense and Paul, who at that point were living in Marseille, and threatened to discontinue his allowance. While in the Midi, C\u00e9zanne often worked with Monticelli (q.v.). His art increasingly matured, and he began concentrating on the order and internal structure within his compositions, limiting his palette. During these years he also met Gauguin (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.), and always trav-eled, chiefly between Aix and L'Estaque. In 1886 C\u00e9zanne married Hortense, his father died, and the inheritance provided him with the financial means to live without constraints. He bought a house in Marlotte near Fontainebleau in 1892. In 1895 he had his first solo show at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard, who two years later bought all the artist's works from his studio near Corbeil. The dealer Paul Durand-Ruel became another important client. C\u00e9zanne participated in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1899, 1901, and 1902 and exhibited at La Libre Esth\u00e9tique in Brussels in 1901 and 1904, the Secession in Vienna in 1903, and the Salon d'Automne in 1904-6. He continued to study the underlying structure of nature, at times approaching abstraction by denying traditional perspective and using multiple viewpoints. He also began leaving portions of the canvas bare, giving some works an unfinished appearance. C\u00e9zanne's work had a tremendous influence on the artists of his time as well as those of subsequent generations, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of modern art.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1839", "death_year": "1906"}], "culture": ["France, late 19th-early 20th Century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 87.5 x 106.5 x 7 cm (34 7/16 x 41 15/16 x 2 3/4 in.); Unframed: 72.2 x 92.4 cm (28 7/16 x 36 3/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.875, "width": 1.065, "depth": 0.07}, "unframed": {"height": 0.722, "width": 0.924}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

He entered the mil-itary at the age of eighteen and served as a saxophone player in an infantry band. Most biographers discount his claim of traveling abroad during the Mexican campaign. In 1871 Rousseau left the military to join the customs service, where he spent fourteen years working on the outskirts of Paris as a minor inspector. After retiring with a small pension in 1885, he pursued the career of a painter and sought portrait commissions. From 1886 to 1910, he exhibited on a regular basis at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, and after 1905, at the Salon d'Automne. Through these activities he became friendly with other artists, including Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), Seurat (q.v), Paul Signac (1863-1935), and Redon (q.v.) who affectionately called him \"le douanier\" (customs officer). Rousseau's paintings were poorly received, and frequently ridiculed in the press, until he attracted a small group of admirers in the early years of this century. This group included Pablo Picasso, Maurice de Vlaminck, Robert Delaunay, Max Weber, and Ardengo Soffici, along with the writers Alfred Jarry, Max Jacob, Andr\u00e9 Salmon, and Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1908, a famous banquet honoring Rousseau was organized at Picasso's studio. Avant-garde artists admired Rousseau's direct, simple vision and his innate talent at clear, pictorial design. However, he aspired to paint in the academic manner of G\u00e9r\u00f4me (q.v.) and Bouguereau (q.v.). Rousseau reportedly told Picasso: \"We are the two greatest artists of this era-you in the Egyptian style, I in the modern style.\"1 Despite growing acclaim in his late years, Rousseau struggled for sales and was forced to supplement his meager income by giving private painting and violin lessons. He occasionally sold works through the dealers Ambroise Vollard and Wilhelm Uhde. In 1909 Rousseau was convicted of complicity in a bank fraud, but authorities suspended the sentence because of his age and apparent failure to comprehend his role in the crime. Rousseau died in Paris of pneumonia in 1910. In 1911 Uhde organized a retrospective at the Ind\u00e9pendants and published the first biography of Rousseau.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1844", "death_year": "1910"}], "culture": ["France, late 19th-early 20th Century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 183 x 203 x 4.5 cm (72 1/16 x 79 15/16 x 1 3/4 in.); Unframed: 170 x 189.5 cm (66 15/16 x 74 5/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.83, "width": 2.03, "depth": 0.045}, "unframed": {"height": 1.7, "width": 1.895}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of the Hanna Fund", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Signed and dated lower right: Henri Rousseau / 1908\r\n\r\n\r\n", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "In Memoriam: Leonard C.

At age thirteen Renoir apprenticed with the porcelain decorators Levy Fr\u00e8res & Cie. He earned money by painting fans, blinds, and murals for caf\u00e9s. In 1860 he registered to copy Old Master paintings in the Louvre and, the following year, entered the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874), where he met Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Monet (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.). In 1862 he was also accepted at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. With his friends from Gleyre's studio, he began working en plein air and, during a visit to the forest of Fontainebleau, was introduced to Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (q.v.). After a failed attempt in 1863, Renoir's first painting was accepted at the Salon of 1864, the same year he painted Cleveland's portrait of Romaine Lacaux. More typical of this early period, however, is the painting Diana the Huntress (1867, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which reveals Courbet's (q.v.) influence. Around 1867 Renoir shared a studio with Bazille and Monet, the latter becoming an important influence on his art. Renoir and Monet's comparable impressionist style during this period is evident in two paintings each made at La grenouill\u00e8re (all four titled La grenouill\u00e8re, 1869: Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and Pushkin Museum, Moscow [Renoir]; National Gallery, London, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Monet]),1 a bathing establishment on the Seine. After Renoir's military service during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Monet introduced him to the dealer Durand-Ruel, who began purchasing his works. Renoir's submissions to the Salon were regularly refused, which encouraged him to participate in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 and the 1875 auction at H\u00f4tel Drouot, where his works were ridiculed by the critics. At the third impressionist exhibition in 1877, he showed Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris), in which he addressed a subject of modern life, one of his most characteristic impressionist paintings on a grand scale, with a rich pattern of light and shadow. In 1878 he returned to the Salon and became quite successful, establishing his reputation as a portraitist (1878, Mme Charpentier and her Children, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He continued to use this official venue for the next several years, declining to exhibit with the impressionists. This decision was partly generated by the fact that his newfound clientele would be more appreciative of his participating in the Salon. He was supported by his patrons, particularly the Charpentiers, owners of a publishing house, whose journal La vie moderne furthered Renoir's reputation. After a trip to North Africa and Italy in 1881, he joined C\u00e9zanne at L'Estaque. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s Renoir traveled extensively through Brittany, Normandy, Provence, and Spain. In the mid-1880s he began to experiment with more linear contours, the application of thinner paint layers, and smoother brush strokes. This so-called Ingresque period, which had a very mixed reception, lasted for about six years. He then reflected upon the achievements of the Old Masters and favored a more fluid style, after which he returned to using broader brush strokes and more vibrant colors. In 1886 he was given a one-man show by Durand-Ruel. By 1900 Renoir was an established artist: he became Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1900 and four years later was honored at the Salon d'Automne with a gallery devoted to his works. Beginning in 1912 he suffered from rheumatism and began using a wheelchair, yet he continued to work until the end of his life. He now often stayed in southern France, where he owned property in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Renoir regularly exhibited his works at the Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune galleries in Paris, as well as elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1841", "death_year": "1919"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 106.7 x 89.2 x 8.9 cm (42 x 35 1/8 x 3 1/2 in.); Unframed: 81.3 x 65 cm (32 x 25 9/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.067, "width": 0.892, "depth": 0.089}, "unframed": {"height": 0.813, "width": 0.65}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of the Hanna Fund", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Signed center right: a. renoir / 1864\r\n\r\n", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "19th and 20th Century French Art and Leonard C.

In 1855 his mother took him back to France where he attended boarding school. He joined the merchant marine when he was seventeen and began traveling around South America. When Gauguin's mother died in 1868, Gustave Arosa, an art collector and photographer, became his legal guardian. Arosa's collection included works by Corot (q.v.), Courbet (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and the Barbizon painters, and it was he who would encourage Gauguin to start painting. In 1872 Arosa found a job for Gauguin at a brokerage firm, giving him financial security. The following year he married a Danish woman, Mette Gad. Gauguin had already started painting and sculpting in his spare time and first exhibited at the Salon in 1876 with a landscape.1 He was asked by Pissarro (q.v.) and Degas (q.v.) to participate in the fourth impressionist exhibition in 1879, where from then on he would exhibit regularly. Durand-Ruel began purchasing his paintings, and in turn Gauguin started to collect the works of his colleagues, such as Manet (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.) and, in particular, C\u00e9zanne (q.v.) and Pissarro. He went to Pontoise in 1882, where he painted with C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro, who along with Degas continued to influence him at this period. In 1883 Gauguin decided to become a full-time artist. In 1884 he moved with his wife and children to Rouen and then to Copenhagen, but he failed to earn a comfortable living. He returned to Paris in 1886 and met ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909), who introduced him to his m\u00e9tier. Gauguin distanced himself from impressionism and in 1888 worked in Pont-Aven with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), who had been experimenting with creating compositions using flat areas of color and dark outlines (cloissonism). Gauguin also studied Japanese prints and Indonesian art. The impact of these influences is evident in Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), so far removed from his earlier impressionist style. Succumbing to van Gogh's (q.v.) many requests, Gauguin agreed to travel to Arles and paint with the artist; their characters, however, proved incompatible. Theo van Gogh, who worked for Boussod Valadon & Cie, would in the meantime sell Gauguin's work. For the next two years, Gauguin traveled often around Brittany. In search of a more pure and unspoiled culture, he auctioned off his paintings in 1891 in order to finance a journey to Tahiti. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find many expatriates and developed areas, yet he was still able to capture in his works an uncultivated spirit. He not only made paintings but also created bold woodcuts and sculptures and was an avid writer. Gauguin returned to France in 1893, where he was given a solo exhibition by Durand-Ruel that was not particularly successful. He decided to leave Europe again in 1895, moving to Tahiti and later to Hivaoa, a more remote island in the Marquesas. Because he abandoned naturalistic colors and used formal distortions in order to achieve expressive compositions, Gauguin's work became an inspiration for many subsequent artists. \r\n1.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to F\u00e9camp, then \u00c9tretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouill\u00e8re on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the H\u00f4tel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to V\u00e9theuil with the Hosched\u00e9s, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hosched\u00e9 spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie.

Here reflection and reality merge in strokes of blue, violet, and green. Fronds of water plants sway underwater and passing clouds are reflected above. By 1915 Monet had conceived a plan, called his Grande D\u00e9coration, for arranging a series of monumental water lily paintings in an oval room, thus creating a continuous panorama that would surround and enclose the viewer in an environment of pure color. That installation is located in two oval rooms in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie in Paris. Cleveland's painting is the left panel of a three-part variation on this water lily theme.

In 1766 he entered the Acad\u00e9mie Royale as the pupil of Joseph-Marie Vien (1716-1809). After several failed attempts, David won the Prix de Rome in 1774. The following year he left for Italy, where he studied antique art and envisioned replacing the frivolity of the rococo with an art of grandeur, simplicity, and moral virtue. After returning to Paris in 1780, he established his reputa-tion with three spectacular successes at the Salon: The Oath of the Horatii (1785, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), The Death of Socrates (1787, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and The Lictors Bring-ing Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). Widely interpreted as moral parables for contemporary political events, these archetypes of neoclassical aesthetics set the standard for academic painting of the next century. In the 1790s David joined the radical Jacobin Club and played an active role in the French Revolution. He allied himself with Robespierre, served a short term as president of the Convention, and voted for the execution of Louis XVI. He also placed his artistic talents at the service of the Revolution by creating paintings that glorified its martyrs and by organizing public festivals that celebrated the new political order. As the most prominent artist in the revolutionary ranks, he led the attack against the Acad\u00e9mie Royale that culminated in its abolish-ment in 1793. When the excesses of the Reign of Terror precipitated the fall of Robespierre in 1794, David was imprison-ed but spared execution. Authorities released him the following year due to ill health. Around 1798 David developed a new alliance with the brilliant young general of the Directory, Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. David's painting The Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) coalesced perfectly with Napoleonic propaganda urging national reconciliation. After the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1799, Napol\u00e9on was named first consul and began supplying David with important commissions. Upon Napol\u00e9on's coronation in 1804, David was appointed first painter to the emperor. David's monumental painting The Coronation of Napol\u00e9on, or Le Sacre (1805-7, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), introduced a less spartan, more colorful and emotive style. However, as seen in his life-size portrait Napol\u00e9on in His Study (1812, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), David increasingly searched to balance this new heroic-romanticism with an exacting realism. In 1816, following Napol\u00e9on's defeat at Waterloo and the restoration of the monarchy, David went into exile in Belgium. He spent the last nine years of his life in Brussels, painting mostly mythological subjects and portraits.

In 1855 his mother took him back to France where he attended boarding school. He joined the merchant marine when he was seventeen and began traveling around South America. When Gauguin's mother died in 1868, Gustave Arosa, an art collector and photographer, became his legal guardian. Arosa's collection included works by Corot (q.v.), Courbet (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and the Barbizon painters, and it was he who would encourage Gauguin to start painting. In 1872 Arosa found a job for Gauguin at a brokerage firm, giving him financial security. The following year he married a Danish woman, Mette Gad. Gauguin had already started painting and sculpting in his spare time and first exhibited at the Salon in 1876 with a landscape.1 He was asked by Pissarro (q.v.) and Degas (q.v.) to participate in the fourth impressionist exhibition in 1879, where from then on he would exhibit regularly. Durand-Ruel began purchasing his paintings, and in turn Gauguin started to collect the works of his colleagues, such as Manet (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.) and, in particular, C\u00e9zanne (q.v.) and Pissarro. He went to Pontoise in 1882, where he painted with C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro, who along with Degas continued to influence him at this period. In 1883 Gauguin decided to become a full-time artist. In 1884 he moved with his wife and children to Rouen and then to Copenhagen, but he failed to earn a comfortable living. He returned to Paris in 1886 and met ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909), who introduced him to his m\u00e9tier. Gauguin distanced himself from impressionism and in 1888 worked in Pont-Aven with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), who had been experimenting with creating compositions using flat areas of color and dark outlines (cloissonism). Gauguin also studied Japanese prints and Indonesian art. The impact of these influences is evident in Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), so far removed from his earlier impressionist style. Succumbing to van Gogh's (q.v.) many requests, Gauguin agreed to travel to Arles and paint with the artist; their characters, however, proved incompatible. Theo van Gogh, who worked for Boussod Valadon & Cie, would in the meantime sell Gauguin's work. For the next two years, Gauguin traveled often around Brittany. In search of a more pure and unspoiled culture, he auctioned off his paintings in 1891 in order to finance a journey to Tahiti. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find many expatriates and developed areas, yet he was still able to capture in his works an uncultivated spirit. He not only made paintings but also created bold woodcuts and sculptures and was an avid writer. Gauguin returned to France in 1893, where he was given a solo exhibition by Durand-Ruel that was not particularly successful. He decided to leave Europe again in 1895, moving to Tahiti and later to Hivaoa, a more remote island in the Marquesas. Because he abandoned naturalistic colors and used formal distortions in order to achieve expressive compositions, Gauguin's work became an inspiration for many subsequent artists. \r\n1.

To these have been attached a series of enamel plaques representing grotesque figures, some of which play musical instruments. Water wheels and bells were added to capture motion and sound. <br>The rich detail, precious materials, and involved ornamentation of this deluxe object suggest it would have been expensive to produce and highly treasured by its original owner, someone of high status, and would have been deployed as an object of spectacle.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to F\u00e9camp, then \u00c9tretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouill\u00e8re on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the H\u00f4tel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to V\u00e9theuil with the Hosched\u00e9s, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hosched\u00e9 spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie.

At age thirteen Renoir apprenticed with the porcelain decorators Levy Fr\u00e8res & Cie. He earned money by painting fans, blinds, and murals for caf\u00e9s. In 1860 he registered to copy Old Master paintings in the Louvre and, the following year, entered the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874), where he met Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Monet (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.). In 1862 he was also accepted at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. With his friends from Gleyre's studio, he began working en plein air and, during a visit to the forest of Fontainebleau, was introduced to Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (q.v.). After a failed attempt in 1863, Renoir's first painting was accepted at the Salon of 1864, the same year he painted Cleveland's portrait of Romaine Lacaux. More typical of this early period, however, is the painting Diana the Huntress (1867, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which reveals Courbet's (q.v.) influence. Around 1867 Renoir shared a studio with Bazille and Monet, the latter becoming an important influence on his art. Renoir and Monet's comparable impressionist style during this period is evident in two paintings each made at La grenouill\u00e8re (all four titled La grenouill\u00e8re, 1869: Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and Pushkin Museum, Moscow [Renoir]; National Gallery, London, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Monet]),1 a bathing establishment on the Seine. After Renoir's military service during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Monet introduced him to the dealer Durand-Ruel, who began purchasing his works. Renoir's submissions to the Salon were regularly refused, which encouraged him to participate in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 and the 1875 auction at H\u00f4tel Drouot, where his works were ridiculed by the critics. At the third impressionist exhibition in 1877, he showed Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris), in which he addressed a subject of modern life, one of his most characteristic impressionist paintings on a grand scale, with a rich pattern of light and shadow. In 1878 he returned to the Salon and became quite successful, establishing his reputation as a portraitist (1878, Mme Charpentier and her Children, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He continued to use this official venue for the next several years, declining to exhibit with the impressionists. This decision was partly generated by the fact that his newfound clientele would be more appreciative of his participating in the Salon. He was supported by his patrons, particularly the Charpentiers, owners of a publishing house, whose journal La vie moderne furthered Renoir's reputation. After a trip to North Africa and Italy in 1881, he joined C\u00e9zanne at L'Estaque. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s Renoir traveled extensively through Brittany, Normandy, Provence, and Spain. In the mid-1880s he began to experiment with more linear contours, the application of thinner paint layers, and smoother brush strokes. This so-called Ingresque period, which had a very mixed reception, lasted for about six years. He then reflected upon the achievements of the Old Masters and favored a more fluid style, after which he returned to using broader brush strokes and more vibrant colors. In 1886 he was given a one-man show by Durand-Ruel. By 1900 Renoir was an established artist: he became Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1900 and four years later was honored at the Salon d'Automne with a gallery devoted to his works. Beginning in 1912 he suffered from rheumatism and began using a wheelchair, yet he continued to work until the end of his life. He now often stayed in southern France, where he owned property in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Renoir regularly exhibited his works at the Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune galleries in Paris, as well as elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1841", "death_year": "1919"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 93 x 82.2 x 9.5 cm (36 5/8 x 32 3/8 x 3 3/4 in.); Unframed: 65.8 x 54.5 cm (25 7/8 x 21 7/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.93, "width": 0.822, "depth": 0.095}, "unframed": {"height": 0.658, "width": 0.545}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with G\u00e9r\u00f4me (q.v.) in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix (q.v.), the prints of Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.\r\nIn 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first Noirs. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial Noirs in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. \r\nDuring the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, Dans le r\u00eave, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel \u00c0 rebours (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin (q.v.) and Vuillard (q.v.). Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarm\u00e9,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art.\r\nAfter 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist.

After attending boarding school in Paris, Pissarro returned to the West Indies to work for his father from 1847 until 1852. As an artist he was largely self-taught, receiving some instruction from Fritz Melbye (1826-1896), a Danish artist with whom he traveled to Venezuela in 1852. When Pissarro returned to Paris in 1855, he shared a studio with Anton Melbye (1818-1875), Fritz's brother, and with David Jacobsen (1821-1871). He took classes at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1856 and three years later attended the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he befriended artists such as C\u00e9zanne (q.v.), Monet (q.v.), and Guillaumin (q.v.). Corot (q.v.) encouraged him to paint landscapes around Paris, and he was listed as Corot's pupil in the catalogues of the Salons of 1864 and 1865. He had met Julie Vellay in 1860, with whom he would have eight children; they married in 1871. Pissarro exhibited regularly at the Salons from 1859 to 1870, although his work received little attention and he sold hardly anything. In 1866 he settled in Pontoise, often returning to Paris where he kept a studio. He frequented \u00c9mile Zola's \"Thursdays\" (weekly literary gatherings) and associated with Manet's (q.v.) artistic circle that gathered in the Caf\u00e9 Guerbois. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) Pissarro fled with his family, first to Montfoucault and then to London, where he worked with Monet and Daubigny (q.v.) and was introduced to the dealer Durand-Ruel. In 1872 he returned to Pontoise, where he painted with C\u00e9zanne. Around 1869 Pissarro began painting in a purely impressionist style, and in 1874 he helped organize the first impressionist exhibition. He moved to \u00c9ragny-sur-Epte in 1884, where he came into contact with Seurat (q.v.) and Paul Signac (1863-1935) and subsequently began to work in a pointillist style. He eventually found this technique too limiting, and returned to an impressionist mode, often working in series. By the end of his career his landscapes and depictions of city life sold well, and in 1892 he was given a retrospective exhibition at Durand-Ruel. By now, the artist had developed strongly anarchist convictions.

Bowing to public demand, Andrew\u2019s would-be executioners attempted to untie him, but their hands were mysteriously paralyzed. Andrew\u2019s desire for martyrdom was thus fulfilled and he died enveloped in divine light. Caravaggio\u2019s innovative interpretation involves the viewer more closely in the event by presenting the crucifixion as intimate and private, rather than as a gruesome public spectacle.

In Paris Daumier studied drawing with Alexandre Lenoir (1761-1839) and at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. Around 1825 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the publisher and lithographer Z\u00e9pherin Belliard (1798-?). The July revolution of 1830, which established Louis-Philippe as the constitutional monarch in France, coincided with Daumier's creation of satirical lithographs aimed at this new government. That same year he joined La Caricature, a political journal founded by the republican artist-publisher, Charles Philipon (1802-1862). Daumier's antimonarchist and liberal subjects that were printed in this paper eventually cost the journal censorship and the artist six months in jail (31 August 1832 to 14 February 1833) plus a 300-franc fine. His prison sentence did not deter him from producing political statements and, in fact, only fueled his rage. The subjects of his lithographs became much more aggressive. In 1835 he worked for Philipon's second publication, Le Charivari, a humorous political newspaper that published Daumier's satirical caricature until it, too, suffered censorship under the new government. Although Daumier may be best known for his graphic art, he was also a sculptor and a prolific painter. Sculpture became another medium to produce his infamous caricatures. His friend, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, French novelist and editor of La Caricature, saw in these works the force of Michelangelo. In 1834 Daumier began experimenting with painting, both in oil and watercolor. Apart from his Salon entries of 1849 and 1850, his paintings, which totaled over three hundred, were painted primarily for his own pleasure and virtually unknown to the public until after his death in 1879.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1808", "death_year": "1879"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "gray and black wash, charcoal, and graphite, with watercolor", "support_materials": [], "department": "Drawings", "collection": "DR - French", "type": "Drawing", "measurements": "Sheet: 26.1 x 19.3 cm (10 1/4 x 7 5/8 in.); Secondary Support: 27.5 x 19.4 cm (10 13/16 x 7 5/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"sheet": {"height": 0.261, "width": 0.193}, "secondary support": {"height": 0.275, "width": 0.194}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Dudley P.

At the age of ten he began studying art and music in Toulouse. In 1797 he entered the Paris studio of David (q.v.), where he became a favorite pupil and assistant. Barely a year later a dispute prompted Ingres to leave the studio and enroll in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In 1801 he won the Prix de Rome, but lack of funds prevented him from departing for Italy until 1806. During fourteen years in Rome and four in Florence, Ingres painted romantic troubadour themes and became an admirer of Raphael. In 1824 he returned to Paris and exhibited at the Salon, where a fierce debate erupted between his supporters and those of Delacroix (q.v.). The controversial Salon of 1824 signaled Ingres's emergence as the leader of the neoclassical movement in France. At that point he effectively assumed the role of his former teacher David, now in exile. In 1833 the French government appointed Ingres vice president of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and president the following year. In 1834 he accepted the directorship of the French Academy in Rome and spent the next seven years painting and studying antique art in Italy. In 1841 he returned to Paris, where his paintings were greeted with thunderous critical acclaim. A major retrospective at the Exposition Universelle of 1855 confirmed his reputation but also aroused the hostility of young artists opposed to academic rules and conventions. During his later years Ingres continued his bitter rivalry with Delacroix, successfully blocking the latter's admission to the academy until 1857. Ingres died in 1867, leaving behind a circle of followers and a remarkable drawing style that was to inspire later artists, including Degas (q.v.) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973).", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1780", "death_year": "1867"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "graphite", "support_materials": [{"description": "cream wove paper", "watermarks": []}], "department": "Drawings", "collection": "DR - French", "type": "Drawing", "measurements": "Sheet: 32.1 x 24 cm (12 5/8 x 9 7/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"sheet": {"height": 0.321, "width": 0.24}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Purchase from the J.

Particularly in the years around 1630, Rembrandt used this popular format to explore different lighting effects and facial expressions. Here, the strong contrast of light and shade shapes the contours of the young man\u2019s face; unusual accessories such as the striped scarf and glittering pendant on a jeweled chain add an exotic touch. Although this painting bears Rembrandt\u2019s monogram, the authorship is not certain.

The drawing in the Marcille sale could also have been either sheet. The Princeton drawing is traceable directly back to the Walferdin sale (Ross 1983).

Like other artists in 18th-century France, Fragonard was deeply influenced by historic imagery of the Garden of Love\u2014a pastoral and idyllic contained landscape. He revisited the specific image seen here multiple times, in two oil paintings (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre and private collection, New York) and another drawing (Princeton University Art Museum).", "wall_description": "Set in a lush garden, this allegory focuses on a woman pleading for help from a statue of Eros. His blindfold alludes to the uncertain outcome of her affair, while the indifferent putto leaning on an orb suggests this woman is not the first to make a desperate appeal to the god of Love. Details like the antique statuary, the woman\u2019s Roman sandals, and her position parallel to the picture plane (much like depictions on ancient sculptural reliefs) reflect Neoclassical style. However, Fragonard\u2019s portrayal of the woman\u2019s feelings through her pose and the billowing robes anticipates Romanticism, a late 18th-century artistic and literary movement that celebrated emotion as a source of aesthetic experience.", "citations": [{"citation": "<em>Catalogue des tableaux et dessins pr\u00e9cieux qui composent le cabinet de M. de Sireul</em>.

He soon befriended romantic painter Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824) and exhibited at his first Salon in 1822 his powerful, moody The Barque of Dante (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). In the next Salon, inspired by the recent events in the Greeks' struggle for independence against the Turks, Delacroix showed Scenes from the Massacres at Chios (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), a painting whose anti-academic composition, free brushwork, and brilliant color caused hostile critics to accuse the artist of the \"massacre of painting.\" Nevertheless, he was awarded a Salon medal and the state purchased the picture. \r\nAfter the early death of G\u00e9ricault, the young artist became the titular head of the French romantic artistic movement, as much for his innovative technique as his new themes. Widely read and an Anglophile, Delacroix drew frequently from British literature, especially Shakespeare, Byron, and Sir Walter Scott. He also developed a strong interest in orientalist subjects, spurred by the five-month trip to Morocco and southern Spain he took in 1832. He stressed the creative and imaginative elements of painting and opposed the academy for its rote learning and the bourgeoisie for its overly materialistic interests. Delacroix discussed his aesthetic ideas with an ever-expanding circle of writers, musicians, and artists that he frequented, including pianist-composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and writer George Sand. But ultimately he developed a personal conception of beauty that could only be expressed in an individualized manner. \r\nRecent studies have revised the long-standing interpretation of Delacroix as a radical, anticlassical, misunderstood, and unsupported genius. He greatly admired antiquity and the classical authors but insisted on avoiding the narrow or didactic view of them offered by the academies. He may not have emulated classical statuary as sources for his figures, but he did often represent heroic nude figures. For all his insistence on invention, Delacroix retained some sense of documentary reconstruction, for he made numerous studies of costumes and weapons and did other kinds of research before tackling certain subjects. From the beginning and throughout his career, Delacroix received many religious and historical painting commissions, from provincial churches to government buildings, under different rulers and even political systems. His allegorical work Liberty Leading the Barricades (1830-31, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) represents the only painting in which the artist referred to a contemporary political event in France, the revolution that overthrew Louis XVIII and the Bourbon monarchy. This, too, was purchased by the state. In 1833 he was asked to decorate with allegories the Salon du Roi of the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the deputies. Their success brought him additional commissions in the same building, such as the library (1838), and then the library in the senate (1841-46), housed in the Palais du Luxembourg. His historical, religious, and allegorical paintings were often criticized by more conservative critics for a lack of decorum, anatomical distortions, too-bright or unnaturalistic color, and free brushwork, but he continued to find work because he was one of the few artists who continued to explore these \"elevated\" genres and had a sure sense of the decorative. \r\nExtremely prolific, Delacroix accomplished a major mural commission for the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris (1850-63) the year before his death. He was even elected in 1857 to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, but younger artists consistently regarded him as antiestablishment and a paragon of artistic experimentation. He wrote extensively on art and aesthetic issues, both in his private diaries and for published journals.1\r\n1. Recently, scholars such as Michele Hannoosh, Painting and the Journal of Eugene Delacroix (Princeton, 1995), have examined the content and style of Delacroix's texts for what they might tell about Delacroix the writer as well as the work and creative process of Delacroix the artist.\r\nDelacroix was one of the most innovative and successful painters of the first half of the 19th century. He is known as the last great history painter and his art is the ideal of Romanticism in the visual arts. Delacroix's career is marked by the paradox between the revolutionary and the conventional. He was in conflict with the artist Ingres and was seen as the leading figure of the French Romantic movement; he was famed for undermining the tradition of painting established by David, yet he benefited from official patronage from the beginning of the Restoration (1814-1830) until the Second Empire (1852-1870).", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1798", "death_year": "1863"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 76 x 87.5 x 7.5 cm (29 15/16 x 34 7/16 x 2 15/16 in.); Unframed: 50.4 x 61.5 cm (19 13/16 x 24 3/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.76, "width": 0.875, "depth": 0.075}, "unframed": {"height": 0.504, "width": 0.615}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of Mr. and Mrs. J.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to F\u00e9camp, then \u00c9tretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouill\u00e8re on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the H\u00f4tel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to V\u00e9theuil with the Hosched\u00e9s, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hosched\u00e9 spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie.

In Paris Daumier studied drawing with Alexandre Lenoir (1761-1839) and at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. Around 1825 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the publisher and lithographer Z\u00e9pherin Belliard (1798-?). The July revolution of 1830, which established Louis-Philippe as the constitutional monarch in France, coincided with Daumier's creation of satirical lithographs aimed at this new government. That same year he joined La Caricature, a political journal founded by the republican artist-publisher, Charles Philipon (1802-1862). Daumier's antimonarchist and liberal subjects that were printed in this paper eventually cost the journal censorship and the artist six months in jail (31 August 1832 to 14 February 1833) plus a 300-franc fine. His prison sentence did not deter him from producing political statements and, in fact, only fueled his rage. The subjects of his lithographs became much more aggressive. In 1835 he worked for Philipon's second publication, Le Charivari, a humorous political newspaper that published Daumier's satirical caricature until it, too, suffered censorship under the new government. Although Daumier may be best known for his graphic art, he was also a sculptor and a prolific painter. Sculpture became another medium to produce his infamous caricatures. His friend, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, French novelist and editor of La Caricature, saw in these works the force of Michelangelo. In 1834 Daumier began experimenting with painting, both in oil and watercolor. Apart from his Salon entries of 1849 and 1850, his paintings, which totaled over three hundred, were painted primarily for his own pleasure and virtually unknown to the public until after his death in 1879.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1808", "death_year": "1879"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 99.5 x 73 x 8 cm (39 3/16 x 28 3/4 x 3 1/8 in.); Unframed: 83.6 x 56.8 cm (32 15/16 x 22 3/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.995, "width": 0.73, "depth": 0.08}, "unframed": {"height": 0.836, "width": 0.568}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

These paintings were sent to Rotterdam, thus securing their safety.

In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-R\u00e9my, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Proven\u00e7al works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1853", "death_year": "1890"}], "culture": ["Netherlands, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 81 x 66.7 x 7.3 cm (31 7/8 x 26 1/4 x 2 7/8 in.); Unframed: 61.6 x 45.7 cm (24 1/4 x 18 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.81, "width": 0.667, "depth": 0.073}, "unframed": {"height": 0.616, "width": 0.457}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

His father intended his son to enroll at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris. After a prolonged illness, however, Puvis instead entered the Facult\u00e9 de Droit. He became interested in art during a trip to Italy in 1846, and the following year he began studying with Henri Scheffer (1798-1862). Puvis returned to Italy in 1848 with Louis Bauderon de Vermeron (1809-1870), where he became interested in the art of mural painting. He entered the atelier of Delacroix (q.v.) for only two weeks, and later that of Couture (q.v.) for three months. Yet, Puvis's chief method of study was to work independently after live models. He was accepted in the Salon of 1850, but his submissions from 1852 through 1859 were rejected. In 1854-55 he decorated the dining room at his brother's country house, Le Brouchy, near Cuiseaux. He won a second-class medal at the Salon of 1861 for Concordia (Mus\u00e9e de Picardie, Amiens), which was purchased by the state. Inspired by the frescoes of Pompeii and by Piero della Francesca's Legend of the True Cross in Arezzo, Puvis pursued his interest in mural painting with great success. He received commissions to create works for the Palais des Arts in Lyons, the Pantheon and the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris, the Boston Public Library, and many others. The artist strove to integrate his mural paintings with the surrounding architecture and to maintain the integrity of the flat wall surface by using broad areas of subdued color. In 1890, together with Meissonier (q.v.) and Rodin (1840-1917), Puvis founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, as a more progressive alternative for the regular Salon.

In 1850 he left Grenoble and moved to Paris to study under Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897), an innovative and nontraditional instructor who developed and published his own unique teaching method based on painting and drawing from memory. Fantin studied with him for six years and then attended the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for less than a year in 1854. Encouraged by J. A. M. Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858 at the Louvre, Fantin-Latour made several trips to London from 1859 to 1881, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy. London collectors appreciated his still lifes, and he began accepting numerous portrait commissions from English patrons. It was in London, through Whistler's brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), that Fantin first learned to etch. After his first Salon submissions were rejected in 1859, Fantin, in an effort to become better known in France, began exhibiting with his friend Manet (q.v.) and future impressionists Renoir (q.v.) and Monet (q.v.). In 1865 Fantin wrote collector Edwin Edwards: \"We form a group and make noise because there are lots of painters about and one is easily overlooked. When we get together . . . we gain strength in numbers and grow more adventurous. I thought it could last. That was my mistake.\" Unlike the realists and the impressionists, Fantin did not paint out of doors; rather, he preferred literary subjects, still lifes, and portraits that could be painted in his studio. In addition to portraits and still lifes, he made numerous paintings and more than 150 prints that were fantasy works and dream visions, paving the way for symbolist artists. These works were inspired by allegorical and mythological subjects as well as motivated by contemporary German composers such as Schumann and Wagner. After Fantin's death in 1904, critic Ren\u00e9-Marc Ferry wrote: \"when he found realism too limited and stifling, he lost himself in dreams, but his dreams went no further than the windows of his studio. Deep down, he was first and foremost a studio artist.\"1\r\n1.

During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with G\u00e9r\u00f4me (q.v.) in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix (q.v.), the prints of Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.\r\nIn 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first Noirs. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial Noirs in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. \r\nDuring the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, Dans le r\u00eave, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel \u00c0 rebours (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin (q.v.) and Vuillard (q.v.). Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarm\u00e9,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art.\r\nAfter 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist.

The subject also aligned with Redon's broader interest in dreams and spirituality around this time and he represented Orpheus several times throughout his career, in various media.

As a drawing material, pastel is similar to charcoal; both are capable of rendering sharp lines and dense forms, as well as diffused edges and powdery evanescence. Here, Redon utilized the velvety tones of pastel to create an image of hypnotic suggestiveness. The head of the poet and musician Orpheus floats on his lyre down the River Hebrus, while a glittering Mount Parnassus\u2014the home of Apollo and the Muses\u2014soars heavenward.", "citations": [{"citation": "<em>Catalogue of International Exhibition of Modern Art</em>.

Initially, however, Manet wanted to pursue a naval career. It was not until he failed the entrance exams for the naval academy that he decided to pursue a career as an artist. In 1850 he entered the studio of Couture (q.v.), whose reputation had risen sharply after exhibiting his Romans of the Decadence (Salon 1847, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Couture wanted to circumvent conventional academic training and combined traditional painting methods with new techniques-for example, allowing underpaint to form an intrinsic part of the final composition, which resulted in a sketchy appearance. Manet would absorb this technique into his work. He had no strict need to sell his artwork; rather, he longed for recognition as an artist. He responded to Charles Baudelaire's call to young artists to paint contemporary life rather than antiquity and take a distanced point of view, because, as Baudelaire stated in his article The Painter of Modern Life (published in Le Figaro, 1863), objectivity is more sincere and honest. In 1863 the Salon jury rejected more than half of the five thousand works submitted, including Manet's D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). In response to the conservative jury of that year, Napoleon III, in an effort to appease the artists as well as discourage antigovernment sentiment, organized the Salon des Refus\u00e9s, which took place in the Palais des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es two weeks after the opening of the official Salon. The painting caused a formidable succ\u00e8s de scandale both for its technique and subject matter. The majority of the people failed to understand that the artist wanted to translate the conventions of the Old Masters into a new idiom that would reflect contemporary society. Two years later the scandal was repeated when Manet's Olympia (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) was accepted into the Salon of 1865. This time the jury was more lenient because fewer academicians were among its members. Even though his work often received severe criticism, Manet continued to submit works to the Salon, which he felt was the only legitimate place to compete and prove himself as an artist. At the time of the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1867, Manet, following Courbet's (q.v.) lead set in 1855, organized his own pavilion next to the Exposition where he showed more than fifty paintings. \u00c9mile Zola, the French writer and critic who may have collaborated with Manet in writing the preface for his one-man exhibition, recognized his talent and modernity. Zola rejected academic painting of the day, including Alexandre Cabanel's (1823-1889) The Birth of Venus (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris), which not only won the gold medal at the Salon of 1863 but was purchased by Napoleon III. Zola vehemently defended Manet against harsh criticism and exalted him as the greatest painter of the nineteenth century. Manet painted a portrait of Zola (Salon 1868, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) that reflected the artist's interest in Japanese prints as well as photography. By the 1870s Manet's palette had lightened and his brushwork became freer and more sketchy. These new features in his painting technique may have resulted from his contact with the younger impressionist group that began exhibiting as such in 1874. Although Manet was friendly with its members and sympathized with their goals, he never exhibited with them and continued to show his paintings at the official Salon. Manet was truly innovative in depicting subjects of urban life. However, during his lifetime he enjoyed little support, and it was not until the impressionists gained general recognition that Manet was acknowledged as a truly modern painter. Henri Matisse (1869-1954) would express his immense admiration for Manet as follows: \"He was the first to act by reflex, thus simplifying the painter's m\u00e9tier, . . . Manet was direct as could be.\"1\r\n1.

About 1872 he began painting her in more momentary, fleeting states. In this painting she appears to be moving, her hair disheveled as she throws a furtive glance to the side. Manet's sketchy brushwork gives the painting a daring unfinished look, suggesting the tempo of modern life. Morisot's pensive, nervous expression suggests that Manet was sympathetic to her struggle for recognition at a time when women were not expected to pursue professional careers.

During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with G\u00e9r\u00f4me (q.v.) in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix (q.v.), the prints of Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.\r\nIn 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first Noirs. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial Noirs in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. \r\nDuring the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, Dans le r\u00eave, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel \u00c0 rebours (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin (q.v.) and Vuillard (q.v.). Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarm\u00e9,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art.\r\nAfter 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist.

C\u00e9zanne enrolled at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin in 1857, entering the studio of Joseph Gibert (1806-1884). Two years later, complying with his father's wishes, he began studying law at the Universit\u00e9 d'Aix while still at the \u00c9cole Gratuite de Dessin. In 1861 C\u00e9zanne finally left law school and followed Zola to Paris where he met Pissarro (q.v.) at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. Probably after his failure to enter the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, he returned to Aix and began working at his father's bank. In 1862, however, C\u00e9zanne returned to Paris, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse and copied the works of the Old Masters in the Louvre. The works he produced during this period reflect the influence of Spanish painters such as Ribera (1591-1562) and Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664), and other predecessors such as Delacroix (q.v.). His submissions to the Salons of 1865 through 1870 (and even through 1881) did not receive the jury's approval; the reinstatement of the Salon des Refus\u00e9s was repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded. C\u00e9zanne traveled often between Aix and Paris until 1870. To escape the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he stayed in the south in L'Estaque, along with his mistress, Hortense Fiquet, whom he had met in 1869. C\u00e9zanne moved back north to Pontoise with Hortense and his son, Paul, in 1872 and worked with Pissarro and met Dr. Paul Gachet. The following year he moved again to nearby Auvers-sur-Oise with his family, continuing his work with Pissarro. In 1874 and 1877 C\u00e9zanne participated in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, but the severe criticism of his works led him to abstain from using this venue again. In 1878 his father learned of the existence of Hortense and Paul, who at that point were living in Marseille, and threatened to discontinue his allowance. While in the Midi, C\u00e9zanne often worked with Monticelli (q.v.). His art increasingly matured, and he began concentrating on the order and internal structure within his compositions, limiting his palette. During these years he also met Gauguin (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.), and always trav-eled, chiefly between Aix and L'Estaque. In 1886 C\u00e9zanne married Hortense, his father died, and the inheritance provided him with the financial means to live without constraints. He bought a house in Marlotte near Fontainebleau in 1892. In 1895 he had his first solo show at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard, who two years later bought all the artist's works from his studio near Corbeil. The dealer Paul Durand-Ruel became another important client. C\u00e9zanne participated in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1899, 1901, and 1902 and exhibited at La Libre Esth\u00e9tique in Brussels in 1901 and 1904, the Secession in Vienna in 1903, and the Salon d'Automne in 1904-6. He continued to study the underlying structure of nature, at times approaching abstraction by denying traditional perspective and using multiple viewpoints. He also began leaving portions of the canvas bare, giving some works an unfinished appearance. C\u00e9zanne's work had a tremendous influence on the artists of his time as well as those of subsequent generations, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of modern art.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1839", "death_year": "1906"}], "culture": ["France, late 19th-early 20th Century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 74.9 x 97.2 x 8.3 cm (29 1/2 x 38 1/4 x 3 1/4 in.); Unframed: 59.2 x 81 cm (23 5/16 x 31 7/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.749, "width": 0.972, "depth": 0.083}, "unframed": {"height": 0.592, "width": 0.81}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

Canaletto often referred to actual buildings in his capricci,<em> </em>manipulating and combining them to create his invented views. The palatial structure in this composition appropriates the neo-Palladian portal to the Palazzo Tasca in Venice; however, the lagoon, peasant figures, and architectural details are artifice. Traces of Canaletto\u2019s graphite underdrawing are visible in the cloudy sky, as are the black chalk lines he carefully ruled in prior to delineating the building with pen and brush. The brown ink outlines of the composition contrast with Canaletto\u2019s tints of transparent gray wash, which animate the drawing through their effect of flickering sunlight. Though three large, painted capricci paintings share compositional elements with this drawing, it is unclear whether it is a preliminary study, or an independent work of art.", "wall_description": "Venice was a major destination for 18th-century aristocrats visiting Europe's cultural sites on the grand tour, and it was fashionable to bring home a Canaletto veduta, or view painting, to commemorate the trip.

The view is animated by the inclusion of peasants in the foreground who go about their daily business and even more so by the effect of sunlight flickering over the city known as La Serenissima, the Most Serene.", "citations": [{"citation": "Hadeln, Detlev von. <em>The Drawings of Antonio Canal, called Canaletto. </em>London: Duckworth, 1929.", "page_number": "Mentioned: p. 14", "url": null}, {"citation": "H.

But he had already shown an interest in art and had also registered to copy at the Louvre. In 1855 he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and became a student of Louis Lamothe (1822-1869), a former pupil of Ingres (q.v.). One year later Degas made the traditional journey to Italy, remaining there for three years. He visited family members in Naples and Florence and attended life classes at the Villa Medici in Rome. A visit to Normandy in 1861 may have introduced him to the racetrack. In Paris he continued to study at the Louvre, where he met Manet (q.v.) in 1862. Apart from his continuous interest in portraiture and history painting, Degas began to pay attention to subjects of modern life. Between 1865 and 1870, he exhibited at the Salon. At the time of the Franco-Prussian War, he enlisted in the artillery, but because of his poor eyesight he served (with Manet) in the infantry. After the war he traveled first to London and, in 1872-73, visited his uncle and brothers who had a cotton business in New Orleans. Degas participated in the first impressionist exhibition of 1874. He continued to exhibit with these artists until 1886 but never completely considered himself a member of the group, preferring to call himself a realist or naturalist. While many of the impressionists painted en plein air, Degas worked with models in his studio and, later in his career, from his imagination. In addition to painting, he experimented often with monotypes, engraving, pastels, sculpture, and photography. He traveled extensively-London, Naples, Spain, Morocco, and Switzerland-but continued to draw his subject matter from modern-day Paris. Other recurring themes would be the female nude and the ballet dancer. After the impressionist exhibition of 1886, Degas no longer participated in group shows. Instead he sold his works to private dealers such as Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. In the 1890s he began his own art collection, which, besides many works on paper, included paintings by such artists as Ingres, C\u00e9zanne (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), and van Gogh (q.v.). His own art at the time became characterized by broader strokes of paint, charcoal, and pastel and the use of more vibrant colors, partly because of problems with his vision. His failing eyesight and poor health caused him to abandon his pursuit of art during the last years of his life.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1834", "death_year": "1917"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 67.6 x 58.4 x 6 cm (26 5/8 x 23 x 2 3/8 in.); Unframed: 49 x 39.4 cm (19 5/16 x 15 1/2 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.676, "width": 0.584, "depth": 0.06}, "unframed": {"height": 0.49, "width": 0.394}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of Leonard C.

As an adolescent, Turner colored engravings for the print sellers and apprenticed with architectural draftsman Thomas Malton (1726-1801). Although he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789, Turner's substantive artistic training came from his numerous self-conducted topographical drawing tours of the British Isles in the early 1790s and from his camaraderie with Thomas Girtin (1775-1802), with whom he copied the masterworks of landscape watercolorist John Robert Cozens (1752-1799) in the collection of Dr. Thomas Monro (1759-1833). Turner submitted his first oil painting, a seascape, for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1796 and was elected an associate member three years later, at the earliest permissible age. Devoted to the academy's lofty mission, as it had been articulated by the recently deceased Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) in his annual lectures to the students of the academy, Turner would relish his election as a full academician in 1802 and would serve as professor of perspective from 1807 until 1837. His masterpieces of the early decades (and there seems an endless succession of works with title to that distinction) were either homages to past masters of landscape painting or entirely personal interpretations of the most extraordinary range of naturalistic effects and subjects. Whether it was The Fifth Plague of Egypt (1800, Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its amalgam of allusions to Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Richard Wilson (1714-1782), The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), with its overt tribute to Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691), or The Fall of an Avalanche in the Grisons (1810, Tate Gallery, London), with its unprecedented invention of horrific naturalistic detail that challenged conventional notions of the sublime in art, the net effect of Turner's achievement was to elevate landscape painting to a status within the traditional hierarchy of genres that it had rarely enjoyed since the seventeenth century. Unlike Constable (q.v.), Turner was an indefatigable traveler abroad. His first visit to Switzerland in 1802 resulted in a spectacular series of exhibition watercolors that boldly established watercolor painting as a vital medium of original expression. A tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhine in 1817 was followed by his first protracted stay in Italy in 1819. After 1820 summer excursions to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and especially Venice were almost annual occurrences. Gradually, and primarily after the 1819 Italian sojourn, Turner's palette lightened. Traditional notions of chiaroscuro, of alternating bands of light and dark earth colors, yielded to compositions orchestrated in brighter hues, in which the various colors move across the painted surface almost at will, little respecting the forms they describe but in perfect balance.\r\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s Turner committed vast amounts of his creative capital to the production of literary and travel illustrations. These kept an entire generation of engravers employed for several decades. Despite the tendency of his era to stigmatize reproductive engraving as an inferior instrument of artistic presentation, Turner was preoccupied with its processes and potential, acutely aware that, long after his pigments had faded, his reputation would be secure in the more durable brilliance of the engraver's deftly crafted reproductions. A second trip to Italy in 1828 may partially account for the heightened coloring of Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (1828, National Gallery, London), which John Ruskin described as a pivotal picture in Turner's career. But there was very little falling off in either technical or thematic invention during the last decades of Turner's life. In major oils like Snow Storm-Steam Boat Off a Harbor's Mouth (1842, Tate Gallery, London) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery, London) and no less measure in the series of elaborately finished Swiss watercolors executed on commission at the end of his life, natural forms occupy an uncertain place between concrete reality and total dissolution by light into the colors and images of what Monet (q.v.) admiringly called the \"exuberant romanticism of Turner's fancy.\" Perspective can be intentionally distorted and the color schemes can approach the brazenly artificial, yet somehow the fundamental truth of Turner's vision, his faith in the supreme forces of nature and in the artist's preeminence as the mediator of that experience, continues to persuade.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1775", "death_year": "1851"}], "culture": ["England, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on canvas", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 123.5 x 153.5 x 12 cm (48 5/8 x 60 7/16 x 4 3/4 in.); Unframed: 92 x 123.2 cm (36 1/4 x 48 1/2 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.235, "width": 1.535, "depth": 0.12}, "unframed": {"height": 0.92, "width": 1.232}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Bequest of John L.

Traces of polychromy and gilding suggest that it was once brightly colored. Drill holes in the hat further indicate that cords and tassels of fabric, typical of a cardinal\u2019s hat, would once have decorated the sculpture. Whether the statue was originally commissioned for an altar in a private chapel or for its artistic value remains unknown.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to F\u00e9camp, then \u00c9tretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouill\u00e8re on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the H\u00f4tel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to V\u00e9theuil with the Hosched\u00e9s, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hosched\u00e9 spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie. Monet is generally considered the most typical exponent of impressionism.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1840", "death_year": "1926"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 91.1 x 118.4 x 13.7 cm (35 7/8 x 46 5/8 x 5 3/8 in.); Unframed: 66.3 x 93 cm (26 1/8 x 36 5/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.911, "width": 1.184, "depth": 0.137}, "unframed": {"height": 0.663, "width": 0.93}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of Mr. and Mrs. J.

Drawings of this size and quality of finish were displayed on walls like paintings, rather than stored in portfolios, with the unfortunate consequence that the Venetian blue paper often faded to a grayish-tan as here.

His method of modeling\u2014wetting and rubbing his black crayon rather than hatching\u2014produces the density of tone and velvety shadow.

In 1855 his mother took him back to France where he attended boarding school. He joined the merchant marine when he was seventeen and began traveling around South America. When Gauguin's mother died in 1868, Gustave Arosa, an art collector and photographer, became his legal guardian. Arosa's collection included works by Corot (q.v.), Courbet (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and the Barbizon painters, and it was he who would encourage Gauguin to start painting. In 1872 Arosa found a job for Gauguin at a brokerage firm, giving him financial security. The following year he married a Danish woman, Mette Gad. Gauguin had already started painting and sculpting in his spare time and first exhibited at the Salon in 1876 with a landscape.1 He was asked by Pissarro (q.v.) and Degas (q.v.) to participate in the fourth impressionist exhibition in 1879, where from then on he would exhibit regularly. Durand-Ruel began purchasing his paintings, and in turn Gauguin started to collect the works of his colleagues, such as Manet (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.) and, in particular, C\u00e9zanne (q.v.) and Pissarro. He went to Pontoise in 1882, where he painted with C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro, who along with Degas continued to influence him at this period. In 1883 Gauguin decided to become a full-time artist. In 1884 he moved with his wife and children to Rouen and then to Copenhagen, but he failed to earn a comfortable living. He returned to Paris in 1886 and met ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909), who introduced him to his m\u00e9tier. Gauguin distanced himself from impressionism and in 1888 worked in Pont-Aven with \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), who had been experimenting with creating compositions using flat areas of color and dark outlines (cloissonism). Gauguin also studied Japanese prints and Indonesian art. The impact of these influences is evident in Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), so far removed from his earlier impressionist style. Succumbing to van Gogh's (q.v.) many requests, Gauguin agreed to travel to Arles and paint with the artist; their characters, however, proved incompatible. Theo van Gogh, who worked for Boussod Valadon & Cie, would in the meantime sell Gauguin's work. For the next two years, Gauguin traveled often around Brittany. In search of a more pure and unspoiled culture, he auctioned off his paintings in 1891 in order to finance a journey to Tahiti. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find many expatriates and developed areas, yet he was still able to capture in his works an uncultivated spirit. He not only made paintings but also created bold woodcuts and sculptures and was an avid writer. Gauguin returned to France in 1893, where he was given a solo exhibition by Durand-Ruel that was not particularly successful. He decided to leave Europe again in 1895, moving to Tahiti and later to Hivaoa, a more remote island in the Marquesas. Because he abandoned naturalistic colors and used formal distortions in order to achieve expressive compositions, Gauguin's work became an inspiration for many subsequent artists. \r\n1.

He was befriended by poet Max Buchon, who would later write the first article on Courbet, claiming that he was the artist for the people. In 1837, hoping that Gustave would become a lawyer, his father sent him to the Coll\u00e8ge Royal in Besan\u00e7on. Despite his father's ambitions, Courbet began to study art at the academy there with Charles-Antoine Flageoulot (1774-1840), a former student of David (q.v.). By 1839 Courbet had moved to Paris to pursue a career in art. He refrained from entering the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, studying instead briefly with Charles de Steuben (1788-1856) and preferring to learn how to paint by copying the works of the Old Masters in the museums. Courbet also wanted to work after life models and enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. He began to submit paintings to the Salon, the majority of which were rejected. In 1846-47 Courbet traveled to the Netherlands where he studied the works of Rembrandt and Hals. The following year ten of his paintings were shown at the Salon, and together with his friends Baudelaire, Champfleury, and Buchon he became labeled a \"realist.\" Courbet's paintings shown at the 1851 Salon-Stonebreakers (1849, formerly Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, destroyed during World War II), Peasants of Flagey (1850-55, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Besan\u00e7on), and The Burial at Ornans (1849-50, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)-elicited criticism. Because Courbet represented the peasants as he saw them, without ennobling or idealizing them, his works met with disapproval. Moreover, these representations of peasants appeared at a time when the upper classes felt threatened by social unrest and by the instability of the republic. In 1855 Courbet financed an independent Pavillon du R\u00e9alisme near the Universal Exposition, where he showed his Painter's Studio (1854-55, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). He began to travel extensively, including visits to Gent, Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Cologne, Mainz, and Strasbourg. He returned to Germany in 1858, and while in Frankfurt, he began to paint the stag hunts he witnessed. The following year he visited the Normandy coast, painting seascapes, some of which became almost abstractions. Courbet turned to still lifes in 1862-63 when visiting the Saintonge area, yet he still continued to create landscapes and portraits. By 1870 he was offered the Legion of Honor but refused it because of his opposition to the imperial government. During the Paris Commune from March to May 1871, Courbet became an active member of the government. As chairman of the Commission for the Protection of the Artistic Monuments of Paris, he suggested the Vend\u00f4me Column be dismantled because it was an imperial symbol. The Commune decided instead to topple the column. When the Commune was defeated, Courbet was held responsible for this act of vandalism and was jailed for six months. In 1873 the government decided to rebuild the column at Courbet's expense. Unable to pay and fearful of being arrested, Courbet moved to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1819", "death_year": "1877"}], "culture": ["France, 19th century"], "technique": "oil on fabric", "support_materials": [], "department": "Modern European Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "Mod Euro - Painting 1800-1960", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 172 x 230 x 8.5 cm (67 11/16 x 90 9/16 x 3 3/8 in.); Unframed: 151.2 x 210.2 cm (59 1/2 x 82 3/4 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 1.72, "width": 2.3, "depth": 0.085}, "unframed": {"height": 1.512, "width": 2.102}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "John L.

It captures the pathos of the moment, based on the Gospel of John (13:23), which states that during the Last Supper one of Christ\u2019s disciples, namely \"whom Jesus loved,\" was resting on his shoulder. As a focus for devotion and contemplation, this sculpture reflects the fundamental religious beliefs rooted in the mysticism that dominated the period. Mysticism was a movement that intended to stimulate the contemplation of Christ\u2019s Passion and suffering. Mysticism encouraged private devotion and religious images, called <em>andachtsbilder</em> (devotional images), appeared in large numbers in late medieval Germany.", "citations": [{"citation": "Gillerman, Dorothy.
