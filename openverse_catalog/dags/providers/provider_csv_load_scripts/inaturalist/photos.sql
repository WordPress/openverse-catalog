--  despite the 2022-05-30 data set having complete observer IDs, we do not use an FK 
    constraint on observer_id in order to save load time
--  photo_id is not unique. There are ~130,000 duplicate photo_ids (~0.1% of photos).
    Both records are saved to the TSV and only one is loaded back into to postgres.
--  TO DO: [One duplicate photo id](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/190995604) is in
    two observations, because the photo contains two species. If observation uuid is
    the only difference across all photo_id duplicates, we could group by other
    attributes and aggregate the taxa accordingly in export_to_json.template.sql
