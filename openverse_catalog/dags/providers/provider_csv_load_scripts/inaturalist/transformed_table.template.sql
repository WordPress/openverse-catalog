    ** Please note: This SQL will not run as is! You must replace offset_num and
    batch_limit with integers representing the records you want to retrieve.

Joining two very large normalized tables is difficult, in any data manipulation system.
PHOTOS has on the order of 120 million records, and OBSERVATIONS has on the order of
70 million records. We have to join them to get at the taxa (species) information for
any given photo. Taxa are the only descriptive text we have for inaturalist photos.

Using image columns version 001 from common.storage.tsv_columns.

        TO DO #685: Figure out aggregating tags and titles or formatting alternate
        foreign ids for photos with multiple taxa and process them separately.

        first inaturalist load.)
