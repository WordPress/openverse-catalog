# SMTP
#   This occurs because the default config is loaded when running `just test --extended`
#   which happens to still have SMTP credential defaults assigned in it. We do not set
#   these anywhere in the dev stack so it can be safely ignored.
# Subdag
#   This appears to be coming from Airflow internals during testing as a result of
#   loading the example DAGs:
#   /usr/local/airflow/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/airflow/example_dags/example_subdag_operator.py:43: RemovedInAirflow3Warning
# distutils
#   Warning in dependency, nothing we can do
# flask
#   Warning in dependency, nothing we can do
#   "removed"/"remoevd" is due to https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4757
