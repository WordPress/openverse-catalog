# SMTP
#   This occurs because the default config is loaded when running `just test --extended`
#   which happens to still have SMTP credential defaults assigned in it. We do not set
#   these anywhere in the dev stack so it can be safely ignored.

    ignore:Fetching SMTP credentials from configuration variables will be deprecated in a future release. Please set credentials using a connection instead:airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning
